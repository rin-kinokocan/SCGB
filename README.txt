This is a cheap game engine in c++ using ncurses.
I named this project "SCGB".
SCGB stands for "Simple (n)Curses Game Base".
As a recursive abbreviation,SCGB stands for
"SCGB Can be Good and Bad". Who knows.

This program is currently capable of drawing ASCII arts,
BitMap files,and handling overlapping of them.

For now,this program is tested only on Linux(Debian).No Windows
support yet.I'll make pdcurses version in near future.
